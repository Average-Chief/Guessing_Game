## 🧩 How It Works

```text
1. Game starts
2. You choose a difficulty level
3. The computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100
4. You start guessing
5. You get hints: "Too high" / "Too low"
6. You either:
   - Guess correctly → Win + see attempts + time
   - Run out of attempts → Lose and see the correct number
7. You choose to play again or quit
```
